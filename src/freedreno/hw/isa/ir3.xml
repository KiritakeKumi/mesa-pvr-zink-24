<!--
The basic idea is to define a hierarchy of encodings, where various
ranges of bits can be either:

* patterns to match to select a sub-encoding (0, 1, x (dontcare))
* instruction parameters (ie. dst register, type, etc)
* range of bits that delegates to another hierarchy (ie. src reg
  encoding which has multiple sub-encodings depending on gpr/const/
  relative)

The root of the encoding hierarchy defines the size.  By the concrete
leaf nodes of an encoding hierarchy all bits should be accounted for
(ie. either defined fields or as 0/1/x).

TODO:
* add optional min/max gen fields for cases where same binary maps
  to different instructions and/or encodings on later gens
* schema
