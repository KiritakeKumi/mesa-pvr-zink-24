/* A simple implementations of breadcrumbs tracking of GPU progress
 * intended to be a last resort when debugging unrecoverable hangs.
 * For best results use Vulkan traces to have a predictable place of hang.
 *
 * For ordinary hangs as a more user-friendly solution use GFR
 * "Graphics Flight Recorder".
 *
 * This implementation aims to handle cases where we cannot do anything
 * after the hang, which is achieved by:
 * - On GPU after each breadcrumb we wait until CPU acks it and sends udp
 *    packet to the remote host;
 * - At specified breadcrumb require explicit user input to continue
 *   execution up to the next breadcrumb.
 *
 * In-driver breadcrumbs also allow more precise tracking since we could
 * target a single GPU packet.
 *
 *
 * Breadcrumbs settings:
 *
 *  TU_BREADCRUMBS=$IP:$PORT,break=$BREAKPOINT:$BREAKPOINT_HITS
 * Where:
 *  $BREAKPOINT - the breadcrumb from which we require explicit ack
 *  $BREAKPOINT_HITS - how many times breakpoint should be reached for
 *   break to occur. Necessary for a gmem mode and re-usable cmdbuffers
 *   in both of which the same cmdstream could be executed several times.
 *
 *
 * A typical work flow would be:
 * - Start listening for breadcrumbs on remote host:
 *    nc -lvup $PORT | xxd -pc -c 4 | awk -Wposix '{printf("%u:%u\n", "0x" $0, a[$0]++)}'
 *
 * - Start capturing command stream:
 *    sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/rd > ~/cmdstream.rd
 *
 * - On device replay the hanging trace with:
 *    TU_BREADCRUMBS=$IP:$PORT,break=-1:0
 *   ! Try to reproduce the hang in a sysmem mode because it would
 *   require much less breadcrumb writes and syncs.
 *
 * - Increase hangcheck period:
 *    echo -n 60000 > /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/hangcheck_period_ms
 *
 * - After GPU hang note the last breadcrumb and relaunch trace with:
 *    TU_BREADCRUMBS=$IP:$PORT,break=$LAST_BREADCRUMB:$HITS
 *
 * - After the breakpoint is reached each breadcrumb would require
 *   explicit ack from the user. This way it's possible to find
 *   the last packet which did't hang.
 *
 * - Find the packet in the decoded cmdstream.
