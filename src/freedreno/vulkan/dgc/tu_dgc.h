/* A DGC layout consists of a collection of template buffers, that represent
 * command streams, draw parameters, etc. and a set of patchpoints. The
 * preprocess buffer contains an array of "maxSequenceCount" buffers for each
 * template buffer with the final data for that sequence, plus the trampoline
 * IB. The preprocess shader takes the template buffers and a sequence of
 * patchpoints for each destination buffer and fills out the final buffers for
 * each sequence.
 *
 * The size of an IB is limited, so we have to support multiple IBs, each with
 * its own trampoline, which means that the layout of the main command stream
 * buffer (which the first trampoline points to) is a bit more complicated. We
 * have to calculate how many sequences can fit in an IB and split it up into
 * IBs, each of which ends in a trampoline pointing to the next IB:
 *
 * T_0 ... IB_0 T_1 -> IB_1 ... T_N -> IB_N
 *
 * Trampolines other than the first one (which is called from the main
 * command stream) are at the end of the previous IB.
