/* The following v3dv_xxx_descriptor structs represent descriptor info that we
 * upload to a bo, specifically a subregion of the descriptor pool bo.
 *
 * The general rule that we apply right now to decide which info goes to such
 * bo is that we upload those that are referenced by an address when emitting
 * a packet, so needed to be uploaded to an bo in any case.
 *
 * Note that these structs are mostly helpers that improve the semantics when
 * doing all that, but we could do as other mesa vulkan drivers and just
 * upload the info we know it is expected based on the context.
 *
 * Also note that the sizes are aligned, as there is an alignment requirement
 * for addresses.
