/* NIR Control Flow Modification
 *
 * This file contains various APIs that make modifying control flow in NIR,
 * while maintaining the invariants checked by the validator, much easier.
 * There are two parts to this:
 *
 * 1. Inserting control flow (ifs and loops) in various places, for creating
 *    IR either from scratch or as part of some lowering pass.
 * 2. Taking existing pieces of the IR and either moving them around or
 *    deleting them.

 * so that it's a free-floating piece of IR that can be either re-inserted
 * somewhere else or deleted entirely.
 *
 * There are several caveats on these functions, see the docs for more
