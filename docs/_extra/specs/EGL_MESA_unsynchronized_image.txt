Overview

    When importing an EGLimage into a texture, some drivers may need
    to make a copy of the buffer in order to have it in a format that
    can be used for sampling. Unlike in the equivalent GLX
    texture-from-pixmap extension, there is no way for an application
    to inform the driver when the contents of the original pixmap have
    been modified so it generally just has to assume the worst and
    update the copy every time the texture is used. This extension
    provides a way for the application to both inform the driver that
    it doesn’t need to automatically keep the contents of the texture
    up-to-date with the EGLimage and also to inform the driver
    whenever any external changes have been made.

New Procedures and Functions

    EGLBoolean eglInvalidateUnsynchronizedImageMESA(EGLDisplay dpy,
                                                    EGLimageKHR image);

Description

    Calling eglInvalidateUnsynchronizedImageMESA performs two things:

    First it informs the driver that the image is unsynchronized. This
    means that if the image is later used as the backing for a
    texture, then any external changes to the image don’t have to be
    automatically reflected in the texture. Typically this would be
    called immediately after creating the image.

    Secondly it also informs the driver that the contents of the image
    may have changed and it should perform any action necessary to
    synchronize the data with any textures created from the image
    before they are next used for sampling. This can be called
    repeatedly whenever necessary. The function would typically be
    called for example in response to damage events on a pixmap that
    the image points to.

Errors

    EGL_FALSE is returned if the function fails, EGL_TRUE otherwise.

    EGL_BAD_DISPLAY is generated if `disp` is not an EGL display connection.

    EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED is generated if `disp` has not been initialized.

    EGL_BAD_PARAMETER is generated if `image` is not an EGL image.
